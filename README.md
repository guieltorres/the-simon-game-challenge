This is a JavaScript implementation of the popular Simon game. The game consists of a sequence of colored buttons that light up, and the player must repeat the sequence by clicking on the corresponding buttons. The sequence becomes longer as the player progresses through the levels, and the game ends if the player makes a mistake.

## Getting Started

To run the game, open the HTML file in a web browser. The game can be started by pressing any key on the keyboard, the player's button presses are compared to the game's sequence, and if they match, the game proceeds to the next level. If the player makes a mistake, the game ends and the player can restart by pressing any key.

## Gameplay

The game has four colored buttons: green, red, yellow, and blue. The player must repeat the sequence of button presses that the game generates. The sequence starts off with one button press and gets longer as the player progresses through the levels.

## Sounds

The game also includes sound effects for the buttons, game over and wrong button press.

Technologies Used

The game is built with JavaScript, and uses jQuery for DOM manipulation. The game logic is contained in a single JavaScript file. The game also uses CSS and HTML for styling and layout.

## Conclusion

This is a basic implementation of the Simon game, and can easily be expanded upon to add additional features and gameplay elements. It can be used as a starting point for creating your own Simon game or similar memory-based games. The Simon game was first introduced by Milton Bradley (now a part of Hasbro) in 1978 and it is still considered a classic game today.
